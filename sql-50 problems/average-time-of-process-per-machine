solution :-


WITH process_times AS (
    SELECT 
            machine_id,
            process_id,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_t,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS Start_t
        FROM Activity
        GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
)

SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(processing_time)::numeric, 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT
