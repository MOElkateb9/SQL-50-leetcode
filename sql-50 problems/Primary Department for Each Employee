solution :-


SELECT  employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR employee_id IN (
                                            SELECT employee_id
                                            FROM Employee
                                            GROUP BY employee_id
                                            HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 )
order by 1 ;


second solution :-

SELECT employee_id , max(department_id) as department_id FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = 1 
UNION
SELECT employee_id , department_id FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
